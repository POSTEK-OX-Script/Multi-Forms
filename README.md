# Multi-Forms
This demo shows OX Script's ability to print drastically different-sized and style label designs with a single script. When loading this demo onto your printer, be sure to load the example .txt command files as they are the files containing the actual label design. The .txt command files are generated with visual label editing software so label design no longer has to take place only through coding. The data inside the label designs is updated right before printing through the OX Script provided in this demo

## Installation

To run this code, you will need to have Python 3.8+ installed on your printer(which comes standard on all POSTEK Printers that support OX Script after May 2023). You will not be able to execute this code directly on your computer as it is intended to be executed on the printer

## Usage

To execute this demo, simply load the .py file into your printer through the POSTEK App. Then to run the program you can initiate it from the printer touch screen or the POSTEK App. 

- Initiating the program from the printer touchscreen
    - On your printer's touch screen, go to settings>Ox Script>[your file name].py. Press it and select Run from the bottom right of the pop-up window
 
- Initiating the program from the POSTEK App
    - Inside the App, select Ox Script from the left-hand side. Connect to the printer that you just moved the files to and select the file from the left-hand side drop-down, click run on the top right-hand corner
